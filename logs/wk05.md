## CSS

AI usually adds multiple fonts to css files, In case one style isn't supported by a machine.

You can assign varables to tags to connect them to the css file. eg 

<h1 class="yellow"> in the html file

.yellow {
    color: yellow
}                   in the css file

Every element is a box: 
1) content : actual content
2) Padding : space inside border
3) Border: the edge
4) Margin: Space outside the border
